# Hearthstone - deck builder

## About project
This is a project I've made as a part of a team, during my course in Codecool. The project is a simulator of a card deck builder, as used in popular game Hearthstone. The project focused mainly on creating dynamic web app, using vanilla JavaScript.

The project uses server created in Python / Flask. On the front-end Javascript was used extensively. For styling, Bootstrap, as well as custom CSS was used.
